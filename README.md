Character Reset
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bippity/CharacterReset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bippity/CharacterReset)
============

Lets players manually reset their character back to the server's SSC default character.
This plugin is branched out from CustomStarterItems to only reset the character as TShock has included starter items into itself.
